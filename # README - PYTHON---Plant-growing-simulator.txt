in PYTHON create a plant growing simulator

Here's a Python program for a simple plant-growing simulator. It tracks the plant's growth through stages based on watering, sunlight, and time.

import time
import random

class Plant:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.stage = 0
        self.water = 5  # Water level (0-10)
        self.sunlight = 5  # Sunlight level (0-10)
        self.health = 100  # Overall health (0-100)
        self.stages = ["Seed", "Sprout", "Small Plant", "Big Plant", "Blooming"]

    def grow(self):
        if self.water > 3 and self.sunlight > 3:
            self.stage = min(self.stage + 1, len(self.stages) - 1)
            print(f"The {self.name} has grown into a {self.stages[self.stage]}!")
        else:
            self.health -= 10
            print(f"The {self.name} is struggling to grow. Health decreased to {self.health}.")

    def water_plant(self):
        self.water = min(self.water + 2, 10)
        print(f"You watered the {self.name}. Water level: {self.water}")

    def give_sunlight(self):
        self.sunlight = min(self.sunlight + 2, 10)
        print(f"You gave sunlight to the {self.name}. Sunlight level: {self.sunlight}")

    def check_status(self):
        print(f"\nPlant: {self.name}")
        print(f"Stage: {self.stages[self.stage]}")
        print(f"Water Level: {self.water}")
        print(f"Sunlight Level: {self.sunlight}")
        print(f"Health: {self.health}\n")

    def time_passes(self):
        self.water = max(self.water - random.randint(0, 2), 0)
        self.sunlight = max(self.sunlight - random.randint(0, 2), 0)
        if self.water == 0 or self.sunlight == 0:
            self.health -= 20
        if self.health <= 0:
            print(f"The {self.name} has died.")
            return False
        return True


def main():
    print("Welcome to the Plant Growing Simulator!")
    plant_name = input("Enter the name of your plant: ")
    plant = Plant(plant_name)

    while True:
        plant.check_status()
        print("What would you like to do?")
        print("1. Water the plant")
        print("2. Give sunlight")
        print("3. Wait")
        print("4. Quit")

        choice = input("Choose an option (1-4): ")

        if choice == "1":
            plant.water_plant()
        elif choice == "2":
            plant.give_sunlight()
        elif choice == "3":
            if not plant.time_passes():
                break
            plant.grow()
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Thanks for playing the Plant Growing Simulator!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

        time.sleep(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Features:

1. Growth Stages: The plant grows from a seed to blooming.


2. Actions: Water the plant, give it sunlight, or wait for time to pass.


3. Health: The plant's health decreases if neglected.


4. Dynamic Gameplay: Water and sunlight levels deplete over time.



Feel free to run this script in your Python environment to simulate growing a plant!
